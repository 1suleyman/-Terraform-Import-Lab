# -Terraform-Import-Lab
In this lab, you learned how to import existing AWS resources (created outside of Terraform) into Terraform state so that Terraform can manage them going forward. This included identifying unmanaged resources, using the AWS CLI to inspect instances, creating matching Terraform resource blocks, and importing the resource with terraform import.
